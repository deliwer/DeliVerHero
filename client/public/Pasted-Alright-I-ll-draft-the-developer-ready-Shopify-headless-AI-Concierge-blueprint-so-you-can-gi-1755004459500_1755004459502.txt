Alright — I’ll draft the **developer-ready Shopify headless + AI Concierge blueprint** so you can give it to a dev (or even no-code deploy it) and have the *exact* launch funnel ready.

We’ll keep it **lean**, **gamified**, and **AI-first**, but designed so two cofounders can run it without paid ads.

## **DeliWer – Shopify Headless GTM Funnel Blueprint**

### **1. Tech Stack & Integrations**

**Base:**

* **Shopify** (for product catalog, checkout, order tracking, fulfillment).
* **Hydrogen + Oxygen** (Shopify’s headless React framework for speed and custom UI).
* **GraphQL Storefront API** (to query products, create carts, process checkouts).

**AI Concierge:**

* **OpenAI API** (GPT-4o-mini for speed)
* **LangChain** (for context memory — trade-in rules, pricing tiers).
* **Webhook** integration to Shopify Functions for checkout automation.

**Gamification & Data:**

* **Firebase Realtime Database** (Leaderboard, Hero stats, referrals).
* **Cloudinary** (User profile pics, shareable badges).
* **Vercel** (Hosting Hydrogen app — fast deploy).

### **2. Page & Funnel Structure**

#### **Page 1 – Hero Challenge Landing Page**

* **Above-the-fold**:

  * “Trade Your Old iPhone for AED 1,000+ in Premium Water — Become a Dubai Planet Hero.”
  * Live **Leaderboard** snippet + “Only X Hero spots left” counter.
* **AI Concierge CTA**: “Check your trade-in value now →” (scrolls to embedded chat).
* **Social Proof**: Carousel of current Heroes (pics + saved liters).

---

#### **Page 2 – AI Concierge (Embedded Chat)**

* Functions:

  1. Greet user → Ask phone model & condition.
  2. Instantly fetch trade-in price from pricing table in Firebase.
  3. Offer reward packages (AquaCafe Starter Kit + perks).
  4. Book pick-up or store drop-off (Google Calendar API integration).
  5. Create a **Hero Profile** in Firebase (name, city, phone model, reward, impact score).
  6. Trigger Shopify checkout with reward product pre-loaded.

---

#### **Page 3 – Impact Dashboard**

* Realtime:

  * Total liters of bottled water replaced.
  * Total CO₂ saved.
  * Top 10 Heroes by points.
* Publicly visible “Hero of the Day” profile.

---

#### **Page 4 – Referral / Share Page**

* After completion, user gets:

  * Unique referral link (tracked in Firebase).
  * AI-generated “Hero Badge” image + short story (ready for Instagram/TikTok).
  * Extra leaderboard points for every successful referral.

---

### **3. Gamification Logic**

**Points System:**

* Trade-in = Base 100 pts.
* Each referral = +50 pts.
* Social share (auto-detected via tagged hashtag) = +25 pts.

**Levels:**

* Level 1: Bronze Hero (starter).
* Level 2: Silver Hero (≥300 pts) — gets free filter refill.
* Level 3: Gold Hero (≥600 pts) — lifetime 10% extra reward value.

### **4. Data Flows**

**Flow 1 – Trade-in Pricing**

```
User → AI Concierge → Firebase Trade-in Table → Show Reward → Shopify Checkout → Fulfillment
```

**Flow 2 – Leaderboard Updates**

```
Trade-in Completion → Firebase Hero Stats Update → Leaderboard API → Landing Page
```

**Flow 3 – Referral Tracking**

```
Referral Link → Firebase → Leaderboard Boost + Reward Credit
```

### **5. AI Concierge Prompt Skeleton**

```plaintext
You are the DeliWer AI Concierge. 
Your role:
1. Greet warmly, make user feel like a Hero.
2. Ask for iPhone model & condition.
3. Calculate trade-in reward using preloaded table.
4. Offer AquaCafe kit reward, explain environmental impact.
5. Book fulfillment.
6. Create a Hero profile and direct them to checkout.
Always highlight urgency: only X Hero spots left today.
```

If you send me:

1. **Your current Liquid/HTML/JSON gamified site files**
2. **Trade-in pricing table** (iPhone models + conditions + reward values)
3. **Exact AquaCafe kit product details** (SKU, price, inventory)

…I can wire this into a **ready-to-deploy Hydrogen + AI Concierge architecture diagram + page mockups** so the dev just builds to spec without guessing.

Do you want me to **start drawing the actual architecture diagram and mockup layout** for these 4 key pages so it’s visually clear for your developer? That will make it truly plug-and-play.
