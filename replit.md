# DeliWer - Dubai's iPhone-to-Water Trade Platform

## Overview
DeliWer is Dubai's pioneering gamified sustainability platform where users engage in real-world eco-missions, such as tech upgrades and water purification, to earn rewards and contribute to environmental betterment. The platform aims to gamify environmental action, allowing users to earn impact points, climb leaderboards, and unlock rewards while making a tangible positive impact on Dubai's environment.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a modern React 18 application built with TypeScript, using Vite for fast development and optimized builds. It employs Wouter for client-side routing, shadcn/ui with Radix UI for accessible components, and Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom Dubai-themed color palette. TanStack Query handles server state management, caching, and real-time data synchronization. The architecture is component-driven, with clear separation of concerns and custom hooks for business logic.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js server, written in TypeScript, following a RESTful API pattern. It features modular route handling, an in-memory storage implementation designed for easy migration to a database, error handling middleware, and request/response logging. The storage layer uses an `IStorage` interface for abstraction.

### Database Design
The application uses a Drizzle ORM schema compatible with PostgreSQL, defining tables for `heroes` (user profiles, gamification data), `tradeIns` (transaction records), `impactStats` (global aggregations), and `referrals`. UUIDs are used for primary keys, with appropriate foreign key relationships.

### AI Integration
OpenAI GPT-4 is integrated for the AI Concierge feature, providing context-aware conversations for trade valuation and user guidance. LangChain is planned for advanced conversation memory and context handling, with fallback mechanisms in place.

### Real-time Features
Real-time capabilities include Firebase Realtime Database simulation for live leaderboard updates and polling-based updates for impact statistics (every 10 seconds). Optimistic UI updates provide immediate user feedback.

### Gamification System
The platform incorporates a multi-tier hero level system (Bronze, Silver, Gold) based on points, a flexible badge system for achievements, real-time leaderboards showcasing environmental impact, and social sharing features.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design incorporates distinct background colors and improved contrast across sections. Cards are enhanced with gradient backgrounds and shadows. Each major section features unique colored backgrounds (blue, emerald, amber, purple, indigo, orange gradients) for clear visual separation. A contextual tooltip hints system provides guided user experiences.

### Feature Specifications
Key features include an interactive onboarding walkthrough with real-time impact calculations, a mission selection interface, gamified onboarding flows, and integration of hero profile creation with backend APIs. It supports water delivery and iPhone trade-ins as core mission types. Navigation is streamlined, combining related functionality like "Impact" and "Rewards."
