## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The frontend is a React 18 application built with TypeScript, using Vite, Wouter for routing, shadcn/ui with Radix UI for components, and Tailwind CSS for styling with a custom Dubai-themed color palette. TanStack Query handles server state management. The architecture is component-driven with custom hooks for business logic.

### Backend Architecture
The backend is an Express.js server, written in TypeScript, following a RESTful API pattern. It features modular route handling, an in-memory storage implementation designed for easy migration to a database, error handling middleware, and request/response logging. The storage layer uses an `IStorage` interface for abstraction.

### Database Design
The application uses a Drizzle ORM schema compatible with PostgreSQL, defining tables for `heroes`, `tradeIns`, `impactStats`, and `referrals`. UUIDs are used for primary keys.

### AI Integration
OpenAI GPT-4 is integrated for the AI Concierge feature, providing context-aware conversations for trade valuation and user guidance. LangChain is planned for advanced conversation memory and context handling.

### Real-time Features
Real-time capabilities include Firebase Realtime Database simulation for live leaderboard updates and polling-based updates for impact statistics. Optimistic UI updates provide immediate user feedback.

### Gamification System
The platform incorporates a multi-tier hero level system (Bronze, Silver, Gold), a flexible badge system for achievements, real-time leaderboards, and social sharing features.

### UI/UX Decisions
The design incorporates distinct background colors, improved contrast, gradient backgrounds and shadows for cards. Each major section features unique colored backgrounds for clear visual separation. A contextual tooltip hints system provides guided user experiences. The AI Concierge is strategically placed for immediate accessibility. Device simulator and trade calculator are unified.

### Feature Specifications
Key features include an interactive onboarding walkthrough with real-time impact calculations, a mission selection interface, gamified onboarding flows, and integration of hero profile creation with backend APIs. It supports water delivery and iPhone trade-ins as core mission types. Navigation is streamlined, combining related functionality like "Impact" and "Rewards." The AquaCafe is the primary Planet Hero Program entry gateway, featuring a starter kit, shower filter gift, and referral program.
